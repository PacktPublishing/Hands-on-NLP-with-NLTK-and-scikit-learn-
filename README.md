## About the Video Course
Your colleagues depend on you to monetize gigabytes of unstructured text data. What do you do?
Taking this course will help you to precisely create new applications with Python and NLP. You will be able to build actual solutions backed by machine learning and NLP processing models with ease.

There is an overflow of text data online nowadays. As a Python developer, you need to create a new solution using Natural Language Processing for your next project. Your colleagues depend on you to monetize gigabytes of unstructured text data. What do you do?
Hands-on NLP with NLTK and scikit-learn is the answer. This course puts you right on the spot, starting off with building a spam classifier in our first video. At the end of the course, you are going to walk away with three NLP applications: a spam filter, a topic classifier, and a sentiment analyzer. There is no need for fancy mathematical theory, just plain English explanations of core NLP concepts and how to apply those using Python libraries.
Taking this course will help you to precisely create new applications with Python and NLP. You will be able to build actual solutions backed by machine learning and NLP processing models with ease.

## Instructions and Navigation
### Assumed Knowledge
To fully benefit from the coverage included in this course, you will need:<br/>
This course is for developers, data scientists, and programmers who want to learn about practical Natural Language Processing with Python in a hands-on way. Developers who have an upcoming project that needs NLP, or a pile of unstructured text data on their hands, and don't know what to do with it, will find this course useful. Prior programming experience with Python is assumed along with being comfortable dealing with machine learning terms such as supervised learning, regression, and classification. No prior Natural Language Processing or text mining experience is needed.
